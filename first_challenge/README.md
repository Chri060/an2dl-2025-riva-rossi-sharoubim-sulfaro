# AN2DL - First challenge: blood cell classification

This challenge involves classifying **96x96 RGB images of blood cells**. 
The dataset is divided into **eight classes**, with each class corresponding to a specific blood cell state. 
The task is a **multi-class classification problem**, where the objective is to accurately assign the correct class label to each image.

The main onjectives are:
- Develop a model capable of identifying the appropriate cell state from the input images.  
- Achieve high classification accuracy while ensuring the model generalizes well across the dataset.

## Results  
The final model achieved an **accuracy of 86%**, reflecting a strong performance in correctly classifying blood cell images across all categories.
